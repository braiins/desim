//! This crate implement a discrete event simulation framework
//! inspired by the SimPy library for Python. It uses the generator
//! feature that is nightly. Once the feature is stabilized, also this
//! crate will use stable. Generators will be the only nightly feature
//! used in this crate.
//!
//! # Simulation
//! A simulation is performed scheduling one or more processes that
//! models the environment you are going to simulate. Your model may
//! consider some kind of finite resource that must be shared among
//! the processes, e.g. a bunch of servers in a simulation on queues.
//!
//! After setting up the simulation, it can be run step-by-step, using
//! the `step()` method, or all at once, with `run()`, until and ending
//! condition is met.
//!
//! The simulation will generate a log of all the events.
//!
/*
//! `nonblocking_run` lets you run the simulation in another thread
//! so that your program can go on without waiting for the simulation
//! to finish.
//!
*/
//! # Process
//! A process is implemented using the rust generators syntax.
//! This let us avoid the overhead of spawning a new thread for each
//! process, while still keeping the use of this framework quite simple.
//!
//! When a new process is created in the simulation, an identifier, of type
//! `ProcessId` is assigned to it. That id can be used to schedule an event that
//! resume the process.
//!
//! A process can be stopped and resumed later on. To stop the process, the
//! generator yields an `Effect` that specify what the simulator should do.
//! For example, a generator can set a timeout after witch it is executed again.
//! The process may also return. In that case it can not be resumed anymore.
//!
//!
//! # Resource
//! A resource is a finite amount of entities that can be used by one process
//! a time. When all the instances of the resource of interest are being used by
//! a process, the requiring one is enqueued in a FIFO and is resumed when the
//! resource become available again. When the process does not need the resource
//! anymore, it must release it.
//!
//! A resource can be created in the simulation using the `create_resource`
//! method, which requires the amount of resource and returns an identifier
//! for that resource that can be used to require and release it.
//!
//! A resource can be required and reelased by a process yielding
//! the corresponding `Effect`. There is no check on the fact that a process
//! yielding `Release` was holding a resource with that ID, but if a resource
//! gets more release then requests, the simulation will panic.
//!
